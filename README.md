# Mini-Twitter

This app is a Tweet clone and It has been made using MVVM architecture using Java language. It has the following structure:
<br>
<br>
## Sections
- [x] Login 
- [x] Register
- [x] List Tweets
- [x] Favorite Tweets
- [x] User Profile<br><br>
## Features
- Select your favorite tweets and see them later in your favorite tweets section.<br><br>
- Create new tweets at any time of the day.<br><br>
- Delete your tweet if your have made a mistake writing it after published.<br><br>
- Update your profile with the photo of your choice and your user data if it's needed.<br><br>
<br>
Additionally I have created a small server in order to serve the data to the application. The server is made with NodeJs. You can see 
the server repository here: https://github.com/FreddyRobert17/android-server <br><br>
